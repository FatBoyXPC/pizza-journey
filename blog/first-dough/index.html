        <p>Hours after my
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/blog/receiving-ooni-fyra#first-real-cook">
First Real Cook
</a>,
I made my first dough. I've never made a pizza dough before, but I followed
<a href="http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm">Jeff's recipe</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2bBvfn3jns">hand mixing video</a>. This part of the process was probably
the easiest part. Sure, the hand mixing wore my arm out, but that was the only
"hard" part about it. Everything that came after this was tough.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/first-dough/dough1.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Dough after mixing in last of flour and the olive oil"
    class="w-64 content-center m-auto">
</a></p>

<p>If you watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2bBvfn3jns">hand mixing video</a>, this picture was taken right after I
added the olive oil and last bit of flour, but before resting it. As you can
see, it's not very smooth, and it's <em>very</em> wet. My dough looked quit a bit
wetter here than Jeff's dough at the same stage, so I was pretty weary about
how things were going.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/first-dough/dough2.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Dough after mixing in last of flour and the olive oil"
    class="w-64 content-center m-auto">
</a></p>

<p>This is after the dough was rested (for 10 minutes), folded, and placed back
into the bowl. I forgot to get a picture of the dough after the rest but before
I folded it, but it was definitely smoother. You can see here that it's night
and day different in smoothness. Seeing the dough smooth out like that gave me
a bit of confidence I wasn't totally screwing everything up. Before I placed
the dough back into the bowl for the next rest, I decided to weigh the ball. It
should have weighed 903g, but it was only 881g. Somehow I was missing 22g. My
confidence quickly plummeted again, but there's no point in starting over now.
I never did figure out what happened.</p>

</div>

<p>The left image is after the dough rested for 20 minutes. Maybe it's me, but it
definitely looks smoother after this rest period. The picture on the right is
after I folded it one last time, but before I let it have it's final rest,
which in this case would be overnight on the counter. I found out later that
it was at <em>this</em> point that I should have portioned this out into 4 dough balls
then let it sit, but hey, this is a learning process and that's exactly why I'm
blogging about it!</p>

</div>

<p>The left image here is after the dough had rested 8.5 hours. You can see that
it quadrupled in size. I was feeling pretty good again as it certainly looks
like it's going to turn out to be a good dough! I went out to run some errands
and I didn't expect to be gone for 3.5 hours. I came back to see the image on
the right. Consider that confidence shattered again. This thing ballooned up
even more, and now I've got these humongous bubbles, which as everything I'd
learned so far, you really don't want with this type of pizza. I knew I wasn't
supposed to punch it down because all the gasses inside the dough are what
makes this dough puff up so much in the oven.</p>

<p>This is when I actually portioned this out into the 4 dough balls. This was
certainly too late as the individual balls didn't have enough rest time and
were a little difficult to stretch out as they only got to rest for about 2
hours after being turned into individual dough balls. When I was stretching
these out to make the pizza, the dough wasn't nearly as soft or supple as the
larger dough ball was when I was portioning it out or folding it. You better
believe the next time I do this that I'll portion these out much sooner!</p>

<p>These were the 4 dough balls, and they go in this order: top left, bottom left,
bottom right, top right. I had actually forgot to take a picture of the first
2 before I covered them, so I uncovered them to snap a quick shot. You can
certainly tell that I got much better at shaping these as I did them. You see
all those bubbles? That's a good thing, and don't let anybody tell you
otherwise!</p>

<p>Those of you with a keen eye might notice what looks like a popped bubble in
two places on the 2nd ball. This picture is me cleaning that up a bit. I feel
like you can see that the repair is done quite well, but there are quite a few
more bubbles present in this ball now.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's now time for...</p>

<h3 id="the-cook">The Cook</h3>

<p>This is really what y'all have been waiting for, so let's just get right to it.
I fired up the oven and came back inside. The dough balls have been resting for
a couple hours, and I had also picked up another premade Publix dough and
portioned it into 2 balls. The way I see it is I'd rather get the screw ups out
of the way with the Publix dough, and hopefully get something decent with one
of my own dough balls.</p>

<p>Well, things were off to a bad start. I checked on the oven and my pizza stone
was so hot that my thermometer gun said the temperature was out of range. Shit.
"How am I going to cool this down?", I thought. "I know, I'll use one of these
Publix dough balls!" I did exactly that, and boy did that thing crisp up
<em>fast</em>. I didn't bother stretching it, really, and it still went from raw dough
to cooked all the way through with a <em>very</em> black exterior in just 60 seconds.
Believe it or not, it was actually decent to snack on after you scraped off the
burnt part. I apologize for not getting a picture of this.</p>

<p>My oven cooled back down to somewhere above 800° F, so I figure it's time I get
stretching one of my dough balls.</p>

<p>This pizza is using the first homemade dough ball. See that gaping hole? I knew
this journey would come with needing to learn the ins and outs, but I didn't
expect to lose a third of my pizza when throwing it into the oven. I suppose
in fairness I didn't really know <em>what</em> to expect. The cornice isn't cooked
nearly enough and there's no charring at all. That said, it was actually still
a soft and chewy crust. You can see that the bottom certainly cooked faster
than the top. I'm thinking I choked down the chimney a little bit too much as
clearly the stone had more than enough heat, but the top of the pizza didn't
receive enough.</p>

<p>Your first thought should immediately be "Where'd the cheese go?!" I was trying
to do too much at once: hold the peel with pizza on it. Hold the oven door.
Hold onto the tongs I used to pull the pizza out. At some point during all this
juggling the pizza fell halfway off the peel and the cheese slid right off. I
was able to catch the pizza from falling, but unfortunately the cheese suffered
a casualty. The cornice here doesn't look spectacular, but it's a clear
improvement over the previous. The bottom had moderate charring. Probably not
enough to be up to standards, but enough that it was cooked all the way through
which is mostly what matters. I'll still be looking to improve on that, though.
This pizza was made with the 2nd homemade dough ball.</p>

<p>This was made with the <em>4th</em> homemade dough ball. What happened to the 3rd?
Well, I couldn't seem to stretch it without tearing it. I was repairing the
holes but it seemed like as I repaired one another would pop up. At some point
2 holes popped up at once and quickly grew quite large, so I scrapped it as
that's the precise reason I made enough dough for 4 pizzas.</p>

<p>The color on the cornice is better, but still not at all what I'm aiming for.
The bottom charring, however, I am quite pleased with here. I have a feeling
that's beginner's luck, though.</p>

<p>This pizza was made with the remaining Publix dough ball. You can see quite a
few differences here, likely most notably on the bottom. See that round ring?
I was having trouble stretching the dough out and this shows it. I definitely
over cooked the pizza on about half of it. I was watching through the viewing
hole on the oven door and pretty much as soon as the cornice puffed up I went
to rotate the pizza, which was conveniently right around the 30 second mark. I
can't believe how fast that part burnt. It's really incredible how much heat
this oven can put out. If you're wondering why there's so much cheese on this,
it's because it was the last cook and who doesn't love cheese?!</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>To be blunt: I'm not that pleased with my results. I also didn't expect to be,
so that's okay. The pizzas were way too small. The cornice (the part you hold
on to) was way too large on most of these. The charring wasn't great anywhere
other than the 3rd pizza's bottom side. I have a few notes of things I know
that I need to do differently, so I'm looking forward to the next time!</p>

<p>I'm not sure if anybody cares about the shot of the pizza before it goes into
the oven. It took me far too long to realize I didn't take those pictures. I
think I'm going to try to make sure I get those, as the progress of that stage
is also important.</p>
