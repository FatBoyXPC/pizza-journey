        <p>I am a lot more confident when making dough now, as the process doesn't have
many variables other than mixing the dough. Sure, ambient temperature, water
temperature, and other variables exist, but those don't affect things nearly
as much as that oven does.</p>

<p>Also adding to my confidence with the dough, all 3 times now that I've made it
have been quite consistent in look and feel (texture, shine/sheen, etc). I
ended up not taking any pictures of the dough throughout the mixing and folding
stage this time. It wasn't intentional, but I guess the consistency made this
feel unnecessary.</p>

<p>Here are the 4 dough balls:</p>

<h3 id="the-cook">The Cook</h3>

<p>
    There's a noticeable theme in this set of cooks. I'm sure you will notice it.
</p>

    alt="Bottom of First Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>
    I messed up the dough a bit when stretching, but hey, that's par for the course
    at this point! The top was a bit over cooked, and the bottom was certainly
    over cooked.
</p>

</div>

<p>
    I didn't mess up the stretch! However, the top isn't even done but the
    bottom is over cooked.
</p>

<p>
    Another stretch that wasn't messed up! Am I getting better? Let's not be
    too sure of that yet! ðŸ¤£  You can see I did have problems launching the
    pizza into the oven. Yet again, the bottom is over cooked, but at least one
    side of the top is "done enough" (but nowhere near the color I want).
</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/third/pizza4top.jpg" target="_blank">

</div>

<p>
    Here I didn't have any issues stretching, and even managed to get it into
    the oven without messing it up! However, you can see here that the top is
    nowhere near done and the bottom is completely done (right on the line of
    over cooked).
</p>

<p>
    Hopefully you notice the theme here is "the bottom seems to be cooking way
    too fast." I knew going into this that balancing dome heat + stone heat
    would be a challenge, but I didn't realize just how hard it would be. I
    will be playing with that exhaust/chimney flap to try and balance things."
</p>

<p>
    It's worth noting I'm actually writing this many months after the fact. I
    got caught up with life and wasn't able to get it updated until I was
    already a few weeks behind. Then I didn't want to update everything all at
    once and procrastinated real hard on it. At least it's written, now!

        <p>After working with the dough balls from last week, I was quite eager to try
making another batch. Over all I had some higher highs, but also a couple lower
lows. Anyway, on to the dough!</p>

</div>

<p>The picture on the left is just after I finished mixing in the oil and the last
of the flour. The picture on the right is after about 25 minutes of rest. If
look closely you can see some of the harder edges did smooth out some, but
there's not too much different.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">

</div>

<p>Here you can see what it looked like after the first bit of folding, then after
20 minutes of rest. The good news is that this dough ball was only 13g short
this time, but some of that was left in the bowl.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough5.jpg" target="_blank">

</a>
</div>

<p>Here's another round of folding, with the next image after a 1.5 hour rest.
I'm not sure if this really counts as a "rest", maybe this is more of a rise?
Bulk fermentation? I'm not sure, and a friend recently clarified this
terminology with me, but I was too lazy to scroll up in our chat to check. You
can certainly see it has risen some and absolutely has more bubble action going
on.</p>

</a>
</div>

<p>This is the final fold of the series. I find it interesting you don't see the
bubbles as much in this image compared to the left image of the pair above. I'm
not sure if that's due to hiding the bubbles on accident, or deflating them,
but it certainly didn't affect the dough quality! The image on the right is
after an hour in the fridge. It absolutely rose a noticeable amount and gained
quite a few bubbles, but it also flattened out. I'm not sure what to think of
this, really I'm just making observations to track the progress. The sooner I
get consistent results, the sooner I can start trying different things.</p>

</div>

<p>After removing the dough from the fridge, it was time to portion it out into 4
dough balls and put them in the fridge overnight.</p>

    alt="Fourth dough ball"
    class="w-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>I figured I'd give a bird's eye view and a closer view of the individual dough
balls, that way detail can be seen if necessary. Ironically, it looks like my
first dough ball looked the best of the series, but they all turned out great
in the end!</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough10.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough10.jpg"
    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This is what the dough balls looked like when I pulled them out of the fridge
at 10am, they had been in there since around 1am. While it looks like they may
have risen some, I think the most noticeable change is the surface looks quite
a bit wetter now than it did going into the fridge. That makes sense, though,
as the flour has had time to absorb more water. These are getting left out on
the counter to come to temperature, shooting for a cook time around 5pm.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough11.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough11.jpg"
    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This is around 5:30pm, and as you can tell I'm already a bit late on getting to
the cook. I had decided to re-make the tomato sauce instead of use the sauce
from the previous week as it had turned bitter, so I over shot the mark a bit.
After I finished preparing the sauce and cheese, I went outside to get the oven
started.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough12.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>I figured it wouldn't hurt to show a closer picture of what the dough looked
like closer to when I was actually going to use it. Unfortunately, this picture
was taken around 7pm. My dog, while he's an absolute stud, decided to jump up
and steal the cheese off the counter while I was outside with the oven. I had
to make another trip to the store, then come back and start the oven back up
as I wasn't about to leave an oven like this on unattended.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/pizza1stretch.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Pizza dough stretched out"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This dough stretched out SO much nicer than the previous batch, and I certainly
attribute that to the amount of time they had to rest after getting portioned.
While I was stretching this I remembered Jeff said something about the dough
should be soft enough to fall and stretch under it's own weight, but I did not
expect it to go this easily! It was almost <em>too</em> willing to stretch. As you can
see above, I accidentally folded part of the dough on top of itself when I was
setting the dough down on the counter. That side was so sticky that it was
basically glued down. I thought about trying to stretch just that one area of
the dough, but the rest of the dough looked good and I really didn't want any
holes. I had 3 more chances to get this right!</p>

    </iframe>
</div>

<p>You can see just how easily this stretched, it required no effort at all. You
can also see how much larger this (and the picture above) stretched than last
week's doughs. Keep an eye out for that in the upcoming pictures.</p>

</div>

<p>As I described earlier, you can see the part where the dough got stuck to
itself. While disappointing, you can see that this stretched much larger than
the pizzas from last week. The crust didn't cook evenly, and although I wanted
to leave it in there to get some color on the other side, I was already worried
about the bottom. You can see I definitely overcooked the bottom a bit.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">

</div>

<p>If you look at the right side, near the bottom, you'll see that I again got
the dough stuck to itself. This dough is so light that it really doesn't take
much to move it, which means even the lightest movement can cause the dough to
come off your hands. The crust has better color, but it still wasn't quite
there. The bottom was now a tad undercooked, but I'd prefer that than
overcooked any day. You can also see the cheese didn't seem all the way melted.</p>

<p>Here you can see this dough nearly takes up the entire peel! This is what
happens when I don't screw up as bad with the dough getting folded onto itself.
While I did do that (look at the lower left corner), it wasn't nearly as bad.
Unfortunately, this ended up being half a calzone. If you look for the 2 right
most pieces of cheese, the one that is about vertical center ended up being so
heavy that it was causing the dough to stick to the peel when launching the
pizza. It's so unfortunate. I couldn't get the dough to slide off the peel and
I ended up having to stick my hand in there and try to push the dough off. It
ended up folding onto the pizza. As you
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/oonipreptable.jpg" target="_blank">
can see
</a>
I didn't have a lot of room to work with my hand. While the bottom turned out
great, the top had some uncooked areas of the dough. That was truly despicable.
I did cut off that bit in the top left and tried that, and my buddy said that
one tiny piece did taste like it could come from the neapolitan pizza place
I frequent here in Tampa. That's a compliment, for sure.</p>

<p>Again, look at the size of the dough! I also screwed this one up (look at the
top center area of the dough). Other than the dough stretching nicely,
everything else was a mess. The oven decided to drop down to 500-600 degrees
which meant I wasn't going to get the bake that I wanted. I added more fuel and
waited about 10 minutes and it wasn't climbing in temperature. It was slightly
raining so I'm not sure if that had something to do with it. I decided to go
ahead and put the pizza in and just get the cook over with knowing it wasn't
going to turn out great. The cheese tasted different, the sauce was gummy, and
the crust/dough ended up being almost cracker like. This was truly an
abomination. The bottom <em>looked</em> great, however it was quite dry and crunchy,
which is not at all what I want.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>First things first: it's clear resting the dough portioned for so long is
<strong><em>crucial</em></strong>. You can see how I was easily able to fill the peel even with
mistakes. I'll be doing this going forward. I think after this success with the
dough I'm going to try letting it sit in the fridge for a couple days to
develop more flavor.</p>

<p>I need to figure out the balance between the floor (stone) and ceiling. I knew
this would be a thing, but I honestly feel like I don't have any sort of handle
on it yet after cooking 10+ pizzas between these two homemade dough batches and
the premade doughs.</p>

<p>In order to achieve consistency with the stone/ceiling, it might be time to
start doing things the exact same to get consistent mess ups, then make changes
from there. I hate to do that as I'd prefer to eyeball things so that I don't
get vastly overcooked/undercooked pizzas, but changing one variable at a time
is a guaranteed way to success.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced I want to do that yet. When I was learning how to smoke meats
I didn't end up having to do that, but I was also getting some real good wins
in less than 10 cooks. I suppose you could argue that some of my pizzas are
only mess ups because of something that's avoidable next time, though (such as
not using too heavy of a piece of cheese to make the pizza stick). Who knows,
maybe that 3rd pizza I made could have been "it".</p>

First Real Cook
</a>,
I made my first dough. I've never made a pizza dough before, but I followed
<a href="http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm">Jeff's recipe</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2bBvfn3jns">hand mixing video</a>. This part of the process was probably
the easiest part. Sure, the hand mixing wore my arm out, but that was the only
"hard" part about it. Everything that came after this was tough.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/first-dough/dough1.jpg" target="_blank">

</a></p>

<p>If you watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2bBvfn3jns">hand mixing video</a>, this picture was taken right after I
added the olive oil and last bit of flour, but before resting it. As you can
see, it's not very smooth, and it's <em>very</em> wet. My dough looked quit a bit
wetter here than Jeff's dough at the same stage, so I was pretty weary about
how things were going.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/first-dough/dough2.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Dough after mixing in last of flour and the olive oil"
    class="w-64 content-center m-auto">
</a></p>

<p>This is after the dough was rested (for 10 minutes), folded, and placed back
into the bowl. I forgot to get a picture of the dough after the rest but before
I folded it, but it was definitely smoother. You can see here that it's night
and day different in smoothness. Seeing the dough smooth out like that gave me
a bit of confidence I wasn't totally screwing everything up. Before I placed
the dough back into the bowl for the next rest, I decided to weigh the ball. It
should have weighed 903g, but it was only 881g. Somehow I was missing 22g. My
confidence quickly plummeted again, but there's no point in starting over now.
I never did figure out what happened.</p>

</div>

<p>The left image is after the dough rested for 20 minutes. Maybe it's me, but it
definitely looks smoother after this rest period. The picture on the right is
after I folded it one last time, but before I let it have it's final rest,
which in this case would be overnight on the counter. I found out later that
it was at <em>this</em> point that I should have portioned this out into 4 dough balls
then let it sit, but hey, this is a learning process and that's exactly why I'm
blogging about it!</p>

</div>

<p>The left image here is after the dough had rested 8.5 hours. You can see that
it quadrupled in size. I was feeling pretty good again as it certainly looks
like it's going to turn out to be a good dough! I went out to run some errands
and I didn't expect to be gone for 3.5 hours. I came back to see the image on
the right. Consider that confidence shattered again. This thing ballooned up
even more, and now I've got these humongous bubbles, which as everything I'd
learned so far, you really don't want with this type of pizza. I knew I wasn't
supposed to punch it down because all the gasses inside the dough are what
makes this dough puff up so much in the oven.</p>

<p>This is when I actually portioned this out into the 4 dough balls. This was
certainly too late as the individual balls didn't have enough rest time and
were a little difficult to stretch out as they only got to rest for about 2
hours after being turned into individual dough balls. When I was stretching
these out to make the pizza, the dough wasn't nearly as soft or supple as the
larger dough ball was when I was portioning it out or folding it. You better
believe the next time I do this that I'll portion these out much sooner!</p>

<p>These were the 4 dough balls, and they go in this order: top left, bottom left,
bottom right, top right. I had actually forgot to take a picture of the first
2 before I covered them, so I uncovered them to snap a quick shot. You can
certainly tell that I got much better at shaping these as I did them. You see
all those bubbles? That's a good thing, and don't let anybody tell you
otherwise!</p>

</a></p>

<p>Those of you with a keen eye might notice what looks like a popped bubble in
two places on the 2nd ball. This picture is me cleaning that up a bit. I feel
like you can see that the repair is done quite well, but there are quite a few
more bubbles present in this ball now.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's now time for...</p>

<h3 id="the-cook">The Cook</h3>

<p>This is really what y'all have been waiting for, so let's just get right to it.
I fired up the oven and came back inside. The dough balls have been resting for
a couple hours, and I had also picked up another premade Publix dough and
portioned it into 2 balls. The way I see it is I'd rather get the screw ups out
of the way with the Publix dough, and hopefully get something decent with one
of my own dough balls.</p>

<p>Well, things were off to a bad start. I checked on the oven and my pizza stone
was so hot that my thermometer gun said the temperature was out of range. Shit.
"How am I going to cool this down?", I thought. "I know, I'll use one of these
Publix dough balls!" I did exactly that, and boy did that thing crisp up
<em>fast</em>. I didn't bother stretching it, really, and it still went from raw dough
to cooked all the way through with a <em>very</em> black exterior in just 60 seconds.
Believe it or not, it was actually decent to snack on after you scraped off the
burnt part. I apologize for not getting a picture of this.</p>

<p>My oven cooled back down to somewhere above 800Â° F, so I figure it's time I get
stretching one of my dough balls.</p>

<p>This pizza is using the first homemade dough ball. See that gaping hole? I knew
this journey would come with needing to learn the ins and outs, but I didn't
expect to lose a third of my pizza when throwing it into the oven. I suppose
in fairness I didn't really know <em>what</em> to expect. The cornice isn't cooked
nearly enough and there's no charring at all. That said, it was actually still
a soft and chewy crust. You can see that the bottom certainly cooked faster
than the top. I'm thinking I choked down the chimney a little bit too much as
clearly the stone had more than enough heat, but the top of the pizza didn't
receive enough.</p>

<p>Your first thought should immediately be "Where'd the cheese go?!" I was trying
to do too much at once: hold the peel with pizza on it. Hold the oven door.
Hold onto the tongs I used to pull the pizza out. At some point during all this
juggling the pizza fell halfway off the peel and the cheese slid right off. I
was able to catch the pizza from falling, but unfortunately the cheese suffered
a casualty. The cornice here doesn't look spectacular, but it's a clear
improvement over the previous. The bottom had moderate charring. Probably not
enough to be up to standards, but enough that it was cooked all the way through
which is mostly what matters. I'll still be looking to improve on that, though.
This pizza was made with the 2nd homemade dough ball.</p>

</div>

<p>This was made with the <em>4th</em> homemade dough ball. What happened to the 3rd?
Well, I couldn't seem to stretch it without tearing it. I was repairing the
holes but it seemed like as I repaired one another would pop up. At some point
2 holes popped up at once and quickly grew quite large, so I scrapped it as
that's the precise reason I made enough dough for 4 pizzas.</p>

<p>The color on the cornice is better, but still not at all what I'm aiming for.
The bottom charring, however, I am quite pleased with here. I have a feeling
that's beginner's luck, though.</p>

<p>This pizza was made with the remaining Publix dough ball. You can see quite a
few differences here, likely most notably on the bottom. See that round ring?
I was having trouble stretching the dough out and this shows it. I definitely
over cooked the pizza on about half of it. I was watching through the viewing
hole on the oven door and pretty much as soon as the cornice puffed up I went
to rotate the pizza, which was conveniently right around the 30 second mark. I
can't believe how fast that part burnt. It's really incredible how much heat
this oven can put out. If you're wondering why there's so much cheese on this,
it's because it was the last cook and who doesn't love cheese?!</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>To be blunt: I'm not that pleased with my results. I also didn't expect to be,
so that's okay. The pizzas were way too small. The cornice (the part you hold
on to) was way too large on most of these. The charring wasn't great anywhere
other than the 3rd pizza's bottom side. I have a few notes of things I know
that I need to do differently, so I'm looking forward to the next time!</p>

<p>I'm not sure if anybody cares about the shot of the pizza before it goes into
the oven. It took me far too long to realize I didn't take those pictures. I
think I'm going to try to make sure I get those, as the progress of that stage
is also important.</p>

        <p>Ethan, a good friend of mine, decided to be a real cool guy and buy me an

have become, and if you'd like, you can read more about it on the <a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/about">About</a> page.</p>

<p>As soon as I got the delivery notification I brought the box inside and
immediately started opening it. I did a quick test fit on my the prep table I
have on my patio and sure enough this thing fits just fine! I didn't have any
wood pellets though, so I knew a trip to the store would be in order.</p>

<p>Here you can see how it easily fits on my prep table, and even get a peek of my
grill behind it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/oonipreptable.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Ooni Fyra on my prep table"
    class="content-center w-64 m-auto">
</a></p>

<p>I decided to head down to my favorite meat market as I figure I can kill two
birds with one stone: pick up a steak and pick up some wood pellets. The way I
see it, if I need to do a burn off cook for the pizza oven, I may as well go
ahead and cook myself a steak (on my grill)!</p>

<p>I also stopped at the grocery store to pick up bread flour, tomatoes, fresh
mozzarella, and everything else I'd need to make a good pizza napoletana. As
you can tell, I clearly wasn't in the mood to drag my feet on this project! I
also picked up a premade pizza dough. This is important later.</p>

<p>I get home, take the Fyra and prep table outside of my covered patio (if you
decide to get one of these, I urge you to be careful of fire hazards as these
get to nearly 1000Â°F!) and start putting it together. It was actually pretty
simple: put in the ash tray that doubles as the pellet ramp, put in the tube
hat acts as the pellet hopper, install the chimney, place the pizza stone, and
there is also a metal flange you need to clip into place they call the
"flamekeeper" - this is meant to prevent the flame reaching all the way to the
front door.</p>

<p>The instructions say to put a couple handful of pellets onto the ash tray and
place a tumbleweed starter on to pof them. Light the starter then slide the
tray back where it goes in the back of the unit. After the starter has burned
completely, you can fill the hopper up to the top. Let these burn all the way
down and you have completed your burn off cook.</p>

<p>While the burn off cook is going, I started my grill and cooked a hanger steak.
By the time I got done eating and cleaning up inside the Fyra had already
finished burning and cooled down enough to handle the unit. I brought it back
inside my covered patio and let it sleep for the night. This thing's about to
get abused, I figure i can take it easy it's first time!</p>

<h3 id="first-real-cook">First <em>Real</em> Cook</h3>

<p>The next day I pulled the premade pizza dough out of the fridge, portioned it
into two dough balls, and set it out. I've recently been using this to make
pretzels, so I fully expected it to be over an hour to come up to room
temperature. While the dough was sitting out, I used this time to prep the
sauce (following Jeff Varasano's <a href="http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm">recipe</a>) and tear up the fresh mozzarella and
pat it dry. If you are wondering why I'd commit such a travesty and use a
premade dough as opposed to making my own - I wanted a good baseline, and
having previous experience with this dough I knew that it was a very wet and
sticky dough, which is crucial to this type of pizza.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/premadedough.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/premadedough.jpg"
    alt="Ooni Fyra on my prep table"
    class="content-center w-64 m-auto">
</a></p>

<p>After everything was prepared and ready to go, I wheeled the prep table out of
the patio again, and fired up the oven. I knew from the previous night that
this thing wouldn't take too long to heat up, so I cleaned up the kitchen then
went to check the temperature of the pizza stone. It read around 600Â° or so,
which means it time to get stretching one of the dough balls! Note: the manual
says to measure the center part of the stone rather than the back. The point
here is that the heat source is at the back of the stone, so obviously the back
parts will be warmer than the front parts. Personally, I was checking all parts
of the stone as I know that making this type of pizza can be finnicky, and I'd
prefer to start the pattern recognition process now rather than later.</p>

<p>This is the first time I've tried to make pizza out of this particular dough,
and let's just say it showed. I struggled stretching this thing. It kept
wanting to shrink back on itself. Usually this means the dough hasn't relaxed
long enough, but I didn't have more time!</p>

<p>Whatever, I worked with what I had, and threw on the sauce and cheese. I
carried my pizza peel out to the oven, checked the stone temp and it was well
over 900Â° F. I placed the pizza, closed the door, and started a timer. After
30 seconds, I open the door and try to get the pizza back onto the peel. No
dice. I ended up having to use my grill's ash rake tool to help slide the
pizza onto the peel. I turned the pizza around, slide it back into the oven,
and closed the door again. Another 30 seconds pass, and I remove the pizza.
When I was rotating the pizza I had immediately noticed the crust on this pizza
was HUGE. Very puffy crust. I actually like that, but this was absurdly large.</p>

<p>The crust was definitely overcooked in some areas. The bottom of the pizza had
mediocre leoparding. I wasn't terribly happy with this pizza, but what can I
expect for literally my first pizza (and cook) with this oven?</p>

<p>I immediately got to stretching the next dough ball and let the oven come back
up to temperature. I get the pizza in the oven and the crust in this puffs up
so high that it ends up enveloping the flamekeeper I previously mentioned. I
had such a hard time getting this pizza out that I burnt the entire back of the
pizza. I ended up pulling the flamekeeper out with the pizza, too.</p>

<p>I intentionally didn't take pictures as these were nowhere near what a good
pizza looks like, and really I was trying to get a feel for how this oven worked.
I will say, however, they definitely tasted better than they looked (assuming
you avoid the burnt parts of the 2nd pizza). I can certainly say that I have
paid $15+ for a worse pizza. That said - that's a pretty low bar, and I'm
shooting for way higher than that.</p>
