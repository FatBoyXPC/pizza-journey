    <div class="border-b border-blue-200 mb-10 pb-4" v-pre>
        <p>After working with the dough balls from last week, I was quite eager to try
making another batch. Over all I had some higher highs, but also a couple lower
lows. Anyway, on to the dough!</p>

<p>The picture on the left is just after I finished mixing in the oil and the last
of the flour. The picture on the right is after about 25 minutes of rest. If
look closely you can see some of the harder edges did smooth out some, but
there's not too much different.</p>

</div>

<p>Here you can see what it looked like after the first bit of folding, then after
20 minutes of rest. The good news is that this dough ball was only 13g short
this time, but some of that was left in the bowl.</p>

<p>Here's another round of folding, with the next image after a 1.5 hour rest.
I'm not sure if this really counts as a "rest", maybe this is more of a rise?
Bulk fermentation? I'm not sure, and a friend recently clarified this
terminology with me, but I was too lazy to scroll up in our chat to check. You
can certainly see it has risen some and absolutely has more bubble action going
on.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the final fold of the series. I find it interesting you don't see the
bubbles as much in this image compared to the left image of the pair above. I'm
not sure if that's due to hiding the bubbles on accident, or deflating them,
but it certainly didn't affect the dough quality! The image on the right is
after an hour in the fridge. It absolutely rose a noticeable amount and gained
quite a few bubbles, but it also flattened out. I'm not sure what to think of
this, really I'm just making observations to track the progress. The sooner I
get consistent results, the sooner I can start trying different things.</p>

<p>After removing the dough from the fridge, it was time to portion it out into 4
dough balls and put them in the fridge overnight.</p>

</div>

<p>I figured I'd give a bird's eye view and a closer view of the individual dough
balls, that way detail can be seen if necessary. Ironically, it looks like my
first dough ball looked the best of the series, but they all turned out great
in the end!</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough10.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This is what the dough balls looked like when I pulled them out of the fridge
at 10am, they had been in there since around 1am. While it looks like they may
have risen some, I think the most noticeable change is the surface looks quite
a bit wetter now than it did going into the fridge. That makes sense, though,
as the flour has had time to absorb more water. These are getting left out on
the counter to come to temperature, shooting for a cook time around 5pm.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough11.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This is around 5:30pm, and as you can tell I'm already a bit late on getting to
the cook. I had decided to re-make the tomato sauce instead of use the sauce
from the previous week as it had turned bitter, so I over shot the mark a bit.
After I finished preparing the sauce and cheese, I went outside to get the oven
started.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/second-dough/dough12.jpg" target="_blank">

    alt="Portioned dough balls"
    class="h-64 inline">

</div>

<p>I figured it wouldn't hurt to show a closer picture of what the dough looked
like closer to when I was actually going to use it. Unfortunately, this picture
was taken around 7pm. My dog, while he's an absolute stud, decided to jump up
and steal the cheese off the counter while I was outside with the oven. I had
to make another trip to the store, then come back and start the oven back up
as I wasn't about to leave an oven like this on unattended.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">

    alt="Pizza dough stretched out"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>This dough stretched out SO much nicer than the previous batch, and I certainly
attribute that to the amount of time they had to rest after getting portioned.
While I was stretching this I remembered Jeff said something about the dough
should be soft enough to fall and stretch under it's own weight, but I did not
expect it to go this easily! It was almost <em>too</em> willing to stretch. As you can
see above, I accidentally folded part of the dough on top of itself when I was
setting the dough down on the counter. That side was so sticky that it was
basically glued down. I thought about trying to stretch just that one area of
the dough, but the rest of the dough looked good and I really didn't want any
holes. I had 3 more chances to get this right!</p>

</div>

<p>You can see just how easily this stretched, it required no effort at all. You
can also see how much larger this (and the picture above) stretched than last
week's doughs. Keep an eye out for that in the upcoming pictures.</p>

</div>

<p>As I described earlier, you can see the part where the dough got stuck to
itself. While disappointing, you can see that this stretched much larger than
the pizzas from last week. The crust didn't cook evenly, and although I wanted
to leave it in there to get some color on the other side, I was already worried
about the bottom. You can see I definitely overcooked the bottom a bit.</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">

</div>

<p>If you look at the right side, near the bottom, you'll see that I again got
the dough stuck to itself. This dough is so light that it really doesn't take
much to move it, which means even the lightest movement can cause the dough to
come off your hands. The crust has better color, but it still wasn't quite
there. The bottom was now a tad undercooked, but I'd prefer that than
overcooked any day. You can also see the cheese didn't seem all the way melted.</p>

<p>Here you can see this dough nearly takes up the entire peel! This is what
happens when I don't screw up as bad with the dough getting folded onto itself.
While I did do that (look at the lower left corner), it wasn't nearly as bad.
Unfortunately, this ended up being half a calzone. If you look for the 2 right
most pieces of cheese, the one that is about vertical center ended up being so
heavy that it was causing the dough to stick to the peel when launching the
pizza. It's so unfortunate. I couldn't get the dough to slide off the peel and
I ended up having to stick my hand in there and try to push the dough off. It
ended up folding onto the pizza. As you
<a href="https://www.fatboyxpc.com/pizza-journey/assets/img/oonipreptable.jpg" target="_blank">
can see
</a>
I didn't have a lot of room to work with my hand. While the bottom turned out
great, the top had some uncooked areas of the dough. That was truly despicable.
I did cut off that bit in the top left and tried that, and my buddy said that
one tiny piece did taste like it could come from the neapolitan pizza place
I frequent here in Tampa. That's a compliment, for sure.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, look at the size of the dough! I also screwed this one up (look at the
top center area of the dough). Other than the dough stretching nicely,
everything else was a mess. The oven decided to drop down to 500-600 degrees
which meant I wasn't going to get the bake that I wanted. I added more fuel and
waited about 10 minutes and it wasn't climbing in temperature. It was slightly
raining so I'm not sure if that had something to do with it. I decided to go
ahead and put the pizza in and just get the cook over with knowing it wasn't
going to turn out great. The cheese tasted different, the sauce was gummy, and
the crust/dough ended up being almost cracker like. This was truly an
abomination. The bottom <em>looked</em> great, however it was quite dry and crunchy,
which is not at all what I want.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>First things first: it's clear resting the dough portioned for so long is
<strong><em>crucial</em></strong>. You can see how I was easily able to fill the peel even with
mistakes. I'll be doing this going forward. I think after this success with the
dough I'm going to try letting it sit in the fridge for a couple days to
develop more flavor.</p>

<p>I need to figure out the balance between the floor (stone) and ceiling. I knew
this would be a thing, but I honestly feel like I don't have any sort of handle
on it yet after cooking 10+ pizzas between these two homemade dough batches and
the premade doughs.</p>

<p>In order to achieve consistency with the stone/ceiling, it might be time to
start doing things the exact same to get consistent mess ups, then make changes
from there. I hate to do that as I'd prefer to eyeball things so that I don't
get vastly overcooked/undercooked pizzas, but changing one variable at a time
is a guaranteed way to success.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced I want to do that yet. When I was learning how to smoke meats
I didn't end up having to do that, but I was also getting some real good wins
in less than 10 cooks. I suppose you could argue that some of my pizzas are
only mess ups because of something that's avoidable next time, though (such as
not using too heavy of a piece of cheese to make the pizza stick). Who knows,
maybe that 3rd pizza I made could have been "it".</p>
