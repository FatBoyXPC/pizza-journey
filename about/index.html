        I recently received an
        <a href="https://ooni.com/products/ooni-fyra" target="_blank">Ooni Fyra pizza oven</a>
        as a gift, and I've decided to write about my journey to making a good
        Neapolitan pizza, in part because it's easier to share this way, and it
        will be a good way to keep track of my progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pizza Making?</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
        If you had asked me a few years ago what a blog of this title would be
        about, it likely would have been about finally finding a good pizza.
        I'm from the midwest, which isn't really known for pizza, except for the
        weird reason that Chicago's pizza casserole (inside out deep dish) has
        quite the notoriety.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        I was constantly unhappy with all of the pizza I had. I ended up in New
        York City back in 2014 and even the 3 random pizza places I tried then
        didn't impress me. I intentionally avoided looking anything up online
        so that I could avoid overhyped and well marketed places, and trusted
        some locals to guide me. Turns out maybe I should have done both, as I
        still hadn't found anything I like.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        In 2015 I ended up in Atlanta, and in a random set of events, at
        <a href="http://www.varasanos.com/" target="_blank">Varasano's Pizzeria</a>. Going in I wasn't
        expecting to be that impressed, as I had always been a bit disappointed
        with pizza. I saw on the menu that this was a thin crust pizza, and I
        feared a crunchy, crumbly, cracker like crust. I couldn't have been
        more wrong. This pizza was soft, not crunchy. It was light. The crust
        was springy and chewy (in a good way). It was everything opposite of
        what I previously thought of as a "thin crust pizza", yet, the crust
        was still somewhat thin. It's hard to explain, but to say the least, I
        absolutely fell in love with this pizza. The owner, Jeff, is also very
        helpful. He has quite a few videos on his
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/varasano/videos" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>
        showing you how to stretch dough, bake the pizzas, etc. He even has
        <a href="http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm" target="_blank">his recipe</a>
        and experimentation results online.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        This is when I learned what Neapolitan pizza (or pizza napoletana, if
        you want to sound cultured) was. I had no idea this was its own style
        of pizza. After speaking with Jeff, though, I learned there was an
        entire world of pizzas like this out there, I just didn't know what to
        look for.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        I started focusing on this type of pizza and it absolutely changed how
        much I enjoyed pizza. I was finally happy with (most of) the pizza
        places I found. In June 2019 I finally made my way to Napoli, or
        Naples, Italy. I can honestly say that clearly my preferred style of
        pizza is this, and that it's also difficult (though not impossible) to
        find a "bad" pizza in Napoli.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        In all honesty, Varasano's pizza is so good that I could believe you
        teleported me a pizza right from Napoli. Don't believe me? The image at
        the top of this page is from L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele. The image
        next to this paragraph is from Varasano's. Eating this pizza took me
        right back to my trip to Napoli. This is a bit unfair of a comparison
        as Jeff normally cooks his pizza just a little bit differently, but
        this is proof that he is more than capable of bringing a piece of
        Napoli over to the US.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Varasano's has left me craving more, but I can't seem to find the same
        quality of pizza in Tampa. The saying goes that if you want the job
        done right to do it yourself. I've taken that attitude with BBQ, and
        had always planned to eventually start making my own pizza, but I
        wasn't prioritizing it. Since a good friend of mine decided to give me
        such a gift (knowing how snobby about pizza I am), I'm going to finally
        learn how to make such a prized pizza. My goal is to make a pizza that
        sends me back to Napoli, just like Jeff's pizza did. I hope you enjoy
        watching my journey!
