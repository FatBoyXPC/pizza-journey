description: Receiving my Ooni Fyra pizza oven, setting it up, and doing the first cook(s)
---

Ethan, a good friend of mine, decided to be a real cool guy and buy me an
[Ooni Fyra pizza oven] for my upcoming birthday. He knows what a pizza snob I
have become, and if you'd like, you can read more about it on the [About] page.

As soon as I got the delivery notification I brought the box inside and
immediately started opening it. I did a quick test fit on my the prep table I
have on my patio and sure enough this thing fits just fine! I didn't have any
wood pellets though, so I knew a trip to the store would be in order.

Here you can see how it easily fits on my prep table, and even get a peek of my
grill behind it:

I decided to head down to my favorite meat market as I figure I can kill two
birds with one stone: pick up a steak and pick up some wood pellets. The way I
see it, if I need to do a burn off cook for the pizza oven, I may as well go
ahead and cook myself a steak (on my grill)!

I also stopped at the grocery store to pick up bread flour, tomatoes, fresh
mozzarella, and everything else I'd need to make a good pizza napoletana. As
you can tell, I clearly wasn't in the mood to drag my feet on this project! I
also picked up a premade pizza dough. This is important later.

I get home, take the Fyra and prep table outside of my covered patio (if you
decide to get one of these, I urge you to be careful of fire hazards as these
get to nearly 1000°F!) and start putting it together. It was actually pretty
simple: put in the ash tray that doubles as the pellet ramp, put in the tube
hat acts as the pellet hopper, install the chimney, place the pizza stone, and
there is also a metal flange you need to clip into place they call the
"flamekeeper" - this is meant to prevent the flame reaching all the way to the
front door.

The instructions say to put a couple handful of pellets onto the ash tray and
place a tumbleweed starter on to pof them. Light the starter then slide the
tray back where it goes in the back of the unit. After the starter has burned
completely, you can fill the hopper up to the top. Let these burn all the way
down and you have completed your burn off cook.

While the burn off cook is going, I started my grill and cooked a hanger steak.
By the time I got done eating and cleaning up inside the Fyra had already
finished burning and cooled down enough to handle the unit. I brought it back
inside my covered patio and let it sleep for the night. This thing's about to
get abused, I figure i can take it easy it's first time!

### First _Real_ Cook {#first-real-cook}

The next day I pulled the premade pizza dough out of the fridge, portioned it
into two dough balls, and set it out. I've recently been using this to make
pretzels, so I fully expected it to be over an hour to come up to room
temperature. While the dough was sitting out, I used this time to prep the
sauce (following Jeff Varasano's [recipe]) and tear up the fresh mozzarella and
pat it dry. If you are wondering why I'd commit such a travesty and use a
premade dough as opposed to making my own - I wanted a good baseline, and
having previous experience with this dough I knew that it was a very wet and
sticky dough, which is crucial to this type of pizza.

After everything was prepared and ready to go, I wheeled the prep table out of
the patio again, and fired up the oven. I knew from the previous night that
this thing wouldn't take too long to heat up, so I cleaned up the kitchen then
went to check the temperature of the pizza stone. It read around 600° or so,
which means it time to get stretching one of the dough balls! Note: the manual
says to measure the center part of the stone rather than the back. The point
here is that the heat source is at the back of the stone, so obviously the back
parts will be warmer than the front parts. Personally, I was checking all parts
of the stone as I know that making this type of pizza can be finnicky, and I'd
prefer to start the pattern recognition process now rather than later.

This is the first time I've tried to make pizza out of this particular dough,
and let's just say it showed. I struggled stretching this thing. It kept
wanting to shrink back on itself. Usually this means the dough hasn't relaxed
long enough, but I didn't have more time!

Whatever, I worked with what I had, and threw on the sauce and cheese. I
carried my pizza peel out to the oven, checked the stone temp and it was well
over 900° F. I placed the pizza, closed the door, and started a timer. After
30 seconds, I open the door and try to get the pizza back onto the peel. No
dice. I ended up having to use my grill's ash rake tool to help slide the
pizza onto the peel. I turned the pizza around, slide it back into the oven,
and closed the door again. Another 30 seconds pass, and I remove the pizza.
When I was rotating the pizza I had immediately noticed the crust on this pizza
was HUGE. Very puffy crust. I actually like that, but this was absurdly large.

The crust was definitely overcooked in some areas. The bottom of the pizza had
mediocre leoparding. I wasn't terribly happy with this pizza, but what can I
expect for literally my first pizza (and cook) with this oven?

I immediately got to stretching the next dough ball and let the oven come back
up to temperature. I get the pizza in the oven and the crust in this puffs up
so high that it ends up enveloping the flamekeeper I previously mentioned. I
had such a hard time getting this pizza out that I burnt the entire back of the
pizza. I ended up pulling the flamekeeper out with the pizza, too.

I intentionally didn't take pictures as these were nowhere near what a good
pizza looks like, and really I was trying to get a feel for how this oven worked.
I will say, however, they definitely tasted better than they looked (assuming
you avoid the burnt parts of the 2nd pizza). I can certainly say that I have
paid $15+ for a worse pizza. That said - that's a pretty low bar, and I'm
shooting for way higher than that.
