title: Third Time's Not a Charm

description: My third attempt at making neapolitan pizza
---

I am a lot more confident when making dough now, as the process doesn't have
many variables other than mixing the dough. Sure, ambient temperature, water
temperature, and other variables exist, but those don't affect things nearly
as much as that oven does.

Also adding to my confidence with the dough, all 3 times now that I've made it
have been quite consistent in look and feel (texture, shine/sheen, etc). I
ended up not taking any pictures of the dough throughout the mixing and folding
stage this time. It wasn't intentional, but I guess the consistency made this
feel unnecessary.

Here are the 4 dough balls:

### The Cook {#the-cook}

<p>
    There's a noticeable theme in this set of cooks. I'm sure you will notice it.
</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1stretch.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1stretch.jpg' }}"
    alt="First Dough Stretched Out"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1top.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1top.jpg' }}"
    alt="Top of First Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1bottom.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza1bottom.jpg' }}"
    alt="Bottom of First Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>
    I messed up the dough a bit when stretching, but hey, that's par for the course
    at this point! The top was a bit over cooked, and the bottom was certainly
    over cooked.
</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2stretch.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2stretch.jpg' }}"
    alt="Second Dough Stretched Out"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2top.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2top.jpg' }}"
    alt="Top of Second Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2bottom.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza2bottom.jpg' }}"
    alt="Bottom of Second Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>
    I didn't mess up the stretch! However, the top isn't even done but the
    bottom is over cooked.
</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3raw.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3raw.jpg' }}"

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3top.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3top.jpg' }}"
    alt="Top of Third Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3bottom.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza3bottom.jpg' }}"
    alt="Bottom of Third Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>
    Another stretch that wasn't messed up! Am I getting better? Let's not be
    too sure of that yet! ðŸ¤£  You can see I did have problems launching the
    pizza into the oven. Yet again, the bottom is over cooked, but at least one
    side of the top is "done enough" (but nowhere near the color I want).
</p>

<div class="text-center m-auto">
<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4top.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4top.jpg' }}"
    alt="Top of Fourth Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4top2.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4top2.jpg' }}"
    alt="Another View of Top of Fourth Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>

<a href="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4bottom.jpg' }}" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ $page->baseUrl . '/assets/img/third/pizza4bottom.jpg' }}"
    alt="Bottom of Fourth Cooked Pizza"
    class="h-64 inline">
</a>
</div>

<p>
    Here I didn't have any issues stretching, and even managed to get it into
    the oven without messing it up! However, you can see here that the top is
    nowhere near done and the bottom is completely done (right on the line of
    over cooked).
</p>

<p>
    Hopefully you notice the theme here is "the bottom seems to be cooking way
    too fast." I knew going into this that balancing dome heat + stone heat
    would be a challenge, but I didn't realize just how hard it would be. I
    will be playing with that exhaust/chimney flap to try and balance things."

<p>
    It's worth noting I'm actually writing this many months after the fact. I
    got caught up with life and wasn't able to get it updated until I was
    already a few weeks behind. Then I didn't want to update everything all at
    once and procrastinated real hard on it. At least it's written, now!
